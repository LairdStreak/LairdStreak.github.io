## My brief review of Anycubic's water washable resin versus Esun's water washable resin.

In this brief comparison, I'll be sharing my thoughts on Anycubic's water washable resin versus Esun's water washable resin in white.

I found that Esun's water washable resin offers good value for its price, but it comes with a few drawbacks. One notable issue is that the prints tend to fade when exposed to sunlight during the curing process. Additionally, over time, these prints can develop unsightly cracks, which was rather disappointing. On a positive note, this resin proved easier to remove from supports and rafts compared to Anycubic's resin. However, I was somewhat let down by the color, as it leaned more towards a milky, creamy white rather than a crisp, bright white that would complement 3D printed models effectively.

On the other hand, I'm currently quite impressed with Anycubic's water washable resin. I have several models still in the process of printing on my 3D printer, and the quality is consistently high. The white hue is strikingly bright and appears to cure more effectively than Esun's counterpart.

For now, this concludes my initial assessment. I plan to follow up with another post, complete with images showcasing the differences between the prints, and I'll offer my final verdict based on my personal preference and how well each resin performs for my specific needs.
