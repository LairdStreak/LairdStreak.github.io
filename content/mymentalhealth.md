**Discovery.**
For a while I suspected I may have ADHD(<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_predominantly_inattentive' _target='_blank'>**Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder**</a>) due to being consistently unfocused and unable to work on one task at a time.
Constantly struggling to pay attention to details, being easily distracted, and often have trouble organizing or finishing tasks.
Finally got an ADHD Diagnosis and things are going a lot better.

**I highly recommend these two books.**
[This is ADHD](https://www.paperplus.co.nz/shop/books/this-is-adhd)<br />
[I am autistic](https://www.paperplus.co.nz/shop/books/non-fiction/health-wellbeing/medicine/i-am-autistic)<br />
**Some good resources to read up on.**
