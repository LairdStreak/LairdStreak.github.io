&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What happened, in your words&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This is a safe place to tell the truth as you experienced it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently went through a separation that has left me feeling lost, raw, and uncertain. It was not just the end of a relationship, but the end of shared routines, hopes, and a future I had pictured. Some days, it feels like a part of me is missing; other days, I just feel numb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What you're feeling now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm carrying a mix of emotions: grief for whatâ€™s over, anger for what went wrong, guilt over what I couldâ€™ve done differently, and fear about being alone. But underneath all that, there's also a quiet hope that maybe this pain is the beginning of something betterâ€”even if I canâ€™t see it clearly yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What this relationship meant to you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This relationship was a big part of my life. It taught me about love, compromise, vulnerability, and also about my own needs and boundaries. I invested so much emotionally, and it hurts that it didnâ€™t lastâ€”but Iâ€™m trying to accept that its ending doesnâ€™t mean I failed. It means I lived, loved, and now must grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What you're learning through this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m learning that healing takes time, and that I need to be more compassionate with myself. Iâ€™m learning that solitude is not the same as loneliness. Iâ€™m starting to notice parts of myself I had forgottenâ€”strength, creativity, curiosity. Even in pain, I see growth happening, slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. What you want to release&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to release the idea that Iâ€™m broken, or unlovable, or that this ending defines my worth. I want to let go of resentment, of replaying conversations in my mind, and of blaming myself. I want to free myself from carrying the weight of something thatâ€™s already over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. What you're reaching toward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m reaching toward peace. Toward rediscovering who I am without this relationship. Toward building a life that feels wholeâ€”whether I share it with someone or not. Iâ€™m reaching toward joy, self-trust, and the quiet confidence that I will be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

Everything feels a little heavier today. It's strange how silence can be so loudâ€”how the absence of one person can echo through every part of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep replaying the last conversation, looking for something I missed. A sign. A clue. Something that could explain why it ended, why it had to hurt this much. I knew love could break you, but I didn't expect it to feel so hollowâ€”like a part of me walked away with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are moments when I think Iâ€™m okay. Iâ€™ll laugh at something, or get distracted, and then suddenly, it hits me againâ€”the realization that theyâ€™re not coming back. That the future I pictured so vividly is now just an empty daydream. It makes me question if any of it was real or if I was just holding onto an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even in this pain, I know healing isnâ€™t linear. Iâ€™ll let myself feel it allâ€”the ache, the confusion, the longingâ€”because I know pretending it doesnâ€™t hurt will only make it last longer. They meant something to me. A lot, actually. And losing that deserves mourning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s next. I donâ€™t know when itâ€™ll stop hurting. But Iâ€™m here, still breathing, still writing, still trying. That has to count for something.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Journal"></category><category term="Journal"></category></entry><entry><title>2025-02-10 Journal Entry</title><link href="https://LairdStreak.github.io/2025-02-10-journal-entry.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-02-10T11:42:00+13:00</published><updated>2025-02-10T11:42:00+13:00</updated><author><name>Laird Streak</name></author><id>tag:lairdstreak.github.io,2025-02-10:/2025-02-10-journal-entry.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Journal entry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;WTF living my worst life right now. I can't believe I'm still stuck in this scenario. I'm so sick of it. I'm so sick of everything. I'm so sick of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I supposed to do to get out of this slump? I'm so tired of feeling like this. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm stuck in this rut. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm never going to get out of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so tired of feeling like I'm never going to be happy. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm never going to be successful. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm never going to be able to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish time could fly right now so that I can heal and move on. I wish I could just fast forward to the future where I'm happy and successful. I wish I could just fast forward to the future where I'm living my best life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuff said. I'm done with this entry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Journal"></category><category term="Journal"></category></entry><entry><title>2024-12-12 Journal Entry</title><link href="https://LairdStreak.github.io/2024-12-12-journal-entry.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-12-12T23:03:00+13:00</published><updated>2024-12-12T23:03:00+13:00</updated><author><name>Laird Streak</name></author><id>tag:lairdstreak.github.io,2024-12-12:/2024-12-12-journal-entry.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What I am thankful for.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am thankful for the people in my life who support and love me unconditionally.
&lt;br&gt;I am thankful for the opportunities that have come my way, allowing me to grow and learn.
&lt;br&gt;I am thankful for the moments of joy and laughter that brighten my days.
&lt;br&gt;I am thankful for the challenges that push me to become a better version of myself.
&lt;br&gt;I am thankful to God above who guides me through life's ups and downs.
&lt;br&gt;
I am thankful that no matter how bad my physical, mental or emotional state is, I can always find something to be thankful for. I am thankful for the gift of life and the chance to make a difference in the world.

In the context of love, this passage can be understood as a reminder that the people, relationships, or things we cherish the most are the ones we invest our hearts and time in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When it comes to whom we love, this verse suggests that love is not merely an emotion or feeling but an active choice. Our love follows where we place our attention and devotion. For instance, if we treasure relationships with family, friends, or a significant other, our hearts will naturally turn toward them. Likewise, if we prioritize our career, wealth, or personal achievements, those things will take center stage in our hearts.

To love someone deeply means making them a priority in your life. It is through investing time, energy, and care into someone that love is nurtured and deepened. The more we cherish and value a person, the more our hearts are inclined toward them.

On a spiritual level, this verse can also point to the idea that when we center our lives around God and His love, our hearts are transformed. The way we love others is deeply connected to the way we view and treasure God's love for us. As we treasure His love, we begin to reflect that love in the way we care for those closest to us.

In summary, "where your treasure is, there your heart will be also" calls us to consider what we value in love and relationships. It challenges us to ensure that our love is not just a fleeting emotion but a reflection of where we truly place our heart.

Even when all else fails and you are in the depths of dispair remember there is allways hope.
&lt;br/&gt;
I am in a terrible place at this time due to lack of focus and being un-able to stick to promises made and best efforts I have let someone down.
&lt;br/&gt;
But even in the worst times there is a rescue God loves me with my flaws and all.
This song is a reminder and I hope it can help some-one else also struggling.

As time goes by, we slowly forget the things that once mattered most. We become consumed by the constant demands of our daily livesâ€”work, routines, obligationsâ€”and before we know it, weâ€™ve become distracted by the meaningless noise around us. The busy moments cloud our vision, and we lose sight of what once made us feel whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationships, the very foundation of our joy and fulfillment, begin to slip through the cracks. We stop prioritizing the people who matter, as we convince ourselves that there will always be time for love later, or that we can fix things 'when things calm down.' But time doesnâ€™t wait for anyone. It keeps moving, and with each passing day, the connection we had with others starts to fade, like an image losing focus. We forget to nurture our bonds, and in doing so, we fall out of loveâ€”not just with others, but sometimes with ourselves, as we neglect the things that truly matter. We allow lifeâ€™s distractions to drown out the quiet moments that once brought us closer to the ones we cherish most. And before we know it, we find ourselves yearning for what we lost, wishing we had remembered to appreciate it before it was too late."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reflection emphasizes how time, along with the distractions and demands of life, can cause us to forget the value of relationships, leading to a slow drift from the ones we love.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Journal"></category><category term="Journal"></category></entry></feed>
