&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What happened, in your words&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This is a safe place to tell the truth as you experienced it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently went through a separation that has left me feeling lost, raw, and uncertain. It was not just the end of a relationship, but the end of shared routines, hopes, and a future I had pictured. Some days, it feels like a part of me is missing; other days, I just feel numb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What you're feeling now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm carrying a mix of emotions: grief for what’s over, anger for what went wrong, guilt over what I could’ve done differently, and fear about being alone. But underneath all that, there's also a quiet hope that maybe this pain is the beginning of something better—even if I can’t see it clearly yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What this relationship meant to you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This relationship was a big part of my life. It taught me about love, compromise, vulnerability, and also about my own needs and boundaries. I invested so much emotionally, and it hurts that it didn’t last—but I’m trying to accept that its ending doesn’t mean I failed. It means I lived, loved, and now must grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What you're learning through this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m learning that healing takes time, and that I need to be more compassionate with myself. I’m learning that solitude is not the same as loneliness. I’m starting to notice parts of myself I had forgotten—strength, creativity, curiosity. Even in pain, I see growth happening, slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. What you want to release&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to release the idea that I’m broken, or unlovable, or that this ending defines my worth. I want to let go of resentment, of replaying conversations in my mind, and of blaming myself. I want to free myself from carrying the weight of something that’s already over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. What you're reaching toward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reaching toward peace. Toward rediscovering who I am without this relationship. Toward building a life that feels whole—whether I share it with someone or not. I’m reaching toward joy, self-trust, and the quiet confidence that I will be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

Everything feels a little heavier today. It's strange how silence can be so loud—how the absence of one person can echo through every part of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep replaying the last conversation, looking for something I missed. A sign. A clue. Something that could explain why it ended, why it had to hurt this much. I knew love could break you, but I didn't expect it to feel so hollow—like a part of me walked away with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are moments when I think I’m okay. I’ll laugh at something, or get distracted, and then suddenly, it hits me again—the realization that they’re not coming back. That the future I pictured so vividly is now just an empty daydream. It makes me question if any of it was real or if I was just holding onto an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even in this pain, I know healing isn’t linear. I’ll let myself feel it all—the ache, the confusion, the longing—because I know pretending it doesn’t hurt will only make it last longer. They meant something to me. A lot, actually. And losing that deserves mourning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what’s next. I don’t know when it’ll stop hurting. But I’m here, still breathing, still writing, still trying. That has to count for something.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Journal"></category><category term="Journal"></category></entry><entry><title>2025-02-10 Journal Entry</title><link href="https://LairdStreak.github.io/2025-02-10-journal-entry.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-02-10T11:42:00+13:00</published><updated>2025-02-10T11:42:00+13:00</updated><author><name>Laird Streak</name></author><id>tag:lairdstreak.github.io,2025-02-10:/2025-02-10-journal-entry.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Journal entry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;WTF living my worst life right now. I can't believe I'm still stuck in this scenario. I'm so sick of it. I'm so sick of everything. I'm so sick of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I supposed to do to get out of this slump? I'm so tired of feeling like this. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm stuck in this rut. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm never going to get out of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so tired of feeling like I'm never going to be happy. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm never going to be successful. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm never going to be able to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish time could fly right now so that I can heal and move on. I wish I could just fast forward to the future where I'm happy and successful. I wish I could just fast forward to the future where I'm living my best life.&lt;/p&gt;

In the context of love, this passage can be understood as a reminder that the people, relationships, or things we cherish the most are the ones we invest our hearts and time in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When it comes to whom we love, this verse suggests that love is not merely an emotion or feeling but an active choice. Our love follows where we place our attention and devotion. For instance, if we treasure relationships with family, friends, or a significant other, our hearts will naturally turn toward them. Likewise, if we prioritize our career, wealth, or personal achievements, those things will take center stage in our hearts.

To love someone deeply means making them a priority in your life. It is through investing time, energy, and care into someone that love is nurtured and deepened. The more we cherish and value a person, the more our hearts are inclined toward them.

On a spiritual level, this verse can also point to the idea that when we center our lives around God and His love, our hearts are transformed. The way we love others is deeply connected to the way we view and treasure God's love for us. As we treasure His love, we begin to reflect that love in the way we care for those closest to us.

In summary, "where your treasure is, there your heart will be also" calls us to consider what we value in love and relationships. It challenges us to ensure that our love is not just a fleeting emotion but a reflection of where we truly place our heart.

As time goes by, we slowly forget the things that once mattered most. We become consumed by the constant demands of our daily lives—work, routines, obligations—and before we know it, we’ve become distracted by the meaningless noise around us. The busy moments cloud our vision, and we lose sight of what once made us feel whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationships, the very foundation of our joy and fulfillment, begin to slip through the cracks. We stop prioritizing the people who matter, as we convince ourselves that there will always be time for love later, or that we can fix things 'when things calm down.' But time doesn’t wait for anyone. It keeps moving, and with each passing day, the connection we had with others starts to fade, like an image losing focus. We forget to nurture our bonds, and in doing so, we fall out of love—not just with others, but sometimes with ourselves, as we neglect the things that truly matter. We allow life’s distractions to drown out the quiet moments that once brought us closer to the ones we cherish most. And before we know it, we find ourselves yearning for what we lost, wishing we had remembered to appreciate it before it was too late."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reflection emphasizes how time, along with the distractions and demands of life, can cause us to forget the value of relationships, leading to a slow drift from the ones we love.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Journal"></category><category term="Journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Hacktober Fest 2023 Update</title><link href="https://LairdStreak.github.io/hacktober-fest-2023-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-12T20:44:00+13:00</published><updated>2023-10-12T20:44:00+13:00</updated><author><name>Laird Streak</name></author><id>tag:lairdstreak.github.io,2023-10-12:/hacktober-fest-2023-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hacktober Fest 2023 participant.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;I have completed the following for Hacktober 2023.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;HacktoberFest 2023&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://LairdStreak.github.io/images/logo.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer, the world of open source software has always fascinated me. The collaborative nature of building and improving software, sharing knowledge, and giving back to the community resonates deeply with my passion for coding. Hacktoberfest, an annual event organized by DigitalOcean and GitHub, offers an incredible opportunity to channel this passion and contribute meaningfully to open source projects. In this essay, I will explain why I am eagerly looking forward to participating in Hacktoberfest 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community and Collaboration:&lt;/strong&gt; Hacktoberfest is a celebration of the global open source community. It brings together developers from all corners of the world, fostering a sense of camaraderie and collaboration that is unparalleled. Engaging with fellow developers, exchanging ideas, and working together on open source projects is a valuable experience. It allows me to grow not only as a developer but also as a member of a vibrant and diverse community.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill Enhancement:&lt;/strong&gt; Contributing to open source projects challenges me to expand my skill set. It pushes me to explore new technologies, programming languages, and frameworks. Whether it's fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or optimizing code, these contributions provide opportunities to learn and improve. Hacktoberfest is a platform where I can take on various challenges and broaden my horizons.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving Back:&lt;/strong&gt; The open source community has given me access to an abundance of free, high-quality software. Contributing to open source projects during Hacktoberfest is a way for me to give back to this community that has nurtured my growth as a developer. It's a chance to contribute to projects that have been instrumental in my own work and help others benefit from my contributions.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Networking:&lt;/strong&gt; Hacktoberfest is not just about code; it's also about building connections. Participating in this event allows me to connect with developers, maintainers, and organizations that share my interests. These connections can lead to future collaborations, job opportunities, and a broader professional network.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resume and Portfolio:&lt;/strong&gt; Open source contributions are a valuable addition to my developer portfolio. They demonstrate my skills, commitment to coding, and ability to work in a team. Having a track record of Hacktoberfest contributions showcases my dedication to the open source ethos and can be an attractive point for potential employers.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem Solving:&lt;/strong&gt; Open source projects often present complex problems and challenges that require creative solutions. By participating in Hacktoberfest, I can sharpen my problem-solving skills. It's an opportunity to tackle real-world issues and find innovative ways to address them, which is an essential skill in the tech industry.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognition and Rewards:&lt;/strong&gt; The feeling of accomplishment that comes with successfully completing Hacktoberfest challenges is incredibly rewarding. Earning a limited-edition Hacktoberfest  digital badges adds a sense of achievement to the experience.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Growth:&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond technical skills, Hacktoberfest fosters personal growth. It teaches discipline, time management, and perseverance. Meeting the challenge of contributing to open source projects within the given time frame requires dedication and determination, qualities that are beneficial in all aspects of life.
&lt;br /&gt;
In conclusion, my eagerness to participate in Hacktoberfest 2023 stems from a deep-rooted passion for coding, community, and collaboration. This event offers a unique platform for developers like me to give back to the open source community, enhance our skills, and connect with like-minded individuals. It is an opportunity for personal and professional growth that I eagerly anticipate and look forward to. Hacktoberfest is not just a coding event; it's a celebration of the spirit of open source, and I am excited to be a part of it.

&lt;p&gt;In this brief comparison, I'll be sharing my thoughts on Anycubic's water washable resin versus Esun's water washable resin in white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that Esun's water washable resin offers good value for its price, but it comes with a few drawbacks. One notable issue is that the prints tend to fade when exposed to sunlight during the curing process. Additionally, over time, these prints can develop unsightly cracks, which was rather disappointing. On a positive note, this resin proved easier to remove from supports and rafts compared to Anycubic's resin. However, I was somewhat let down by the color, as it leaned more towards a milky, creamy white rather than a crisp, bright white that would complement 3D printed models effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I'm currently quite impressed with Anycubic's water washable resin. I have several models still in the process of printing on my 3D printer, and the quality is consistently high. The white hue is strikingly bright and appears to cure more effectively than Esun's counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, this concludes my initial assessment. I plan to follow up with another post, complete with images showcasing the differences between the prints, and I'll offer my final verdict based on my personal preference and how well each resin performs for my specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Just decide that, “I’m going to give it everything I’ve got, to make this day a beautiful day.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I’m going to be kind to everyone I meet. I’m going to be gentle and sweet to everyone, even if they hate me. I love my life and I look forward to today.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some Gratitude Quotes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them.” —John F. Kennedy
“I awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends, the old and the new.” —Ralph Waldo Emerson
 “Reflect upon your present blessings—of which every man has many—not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some.” —Charles Dickens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a great time and remember to always be grateful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Fluff"></category><category term="Fluff"></category></entry><entry><title>My ADHD Journey Post</title><link href="https://LairdStreak.github.io/my-adhd-journey-post.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-09-17T18:45:00+12:00</published><updated>2023-09-17T18:45:00+12:00</updated><author><name>Laird Streak</name></author><id>tag:lairdstreak.github.io,2023-09-17:/my-adhd-journey-post.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mental Health.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovery.&lt;/strong&gt;
For a while I suspected I may have ADHD(&lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_predominantly_inattentive' _target='_blank'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) due to being consistently unfocused and unable to work on one task at a time.
Constantly struggling to pay attention to details, being easily distracted, and often have trouble organizing or finishing tasks.
Finally got an ADHD Diagnosis and things are going a lot better.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I highly recommend these two books.&lt;/strong&gt;
